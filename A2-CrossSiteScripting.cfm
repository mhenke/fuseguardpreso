      <h1>A2-Cross Site Scripting (XSS)</h1>
<p style="font-size: 22px;">
	XSS flaws occur whenever an application takes untrusted data and sends it to a web browser without proper validation and escaping. XSS allows attackers to execute scripts in the victimâ€™s browser which can hijack user sessions, deface web sites, or redirect the user to malicious sites.
